Write a c++ program that generates a convex hull inside a feasible region in any dimension and for any number of constraints. (-)
	Write a matlab program that generates a convex hull inside a feasible region for 2 dimensions. (-)
		Clean up previous simplicial matlab code. (-)
			In the computation of the initial hull, make sure the simplex lives in d-space (e.g. in 2D, all the vertices are not colinear). (+)
				Make use of condition numbers (although not always perfect results). (+)
			Print the random number generator in the start of program to debug random phenomena. (+)
	It takes 3.5 seconds to just compute the initial hull in Matlab for 2 dimensions. Write the code in C++ and compare. (-)
		Ensure that the constraints are encoded correctly by checking the feasible volume through sampling. (+)
		Use nlopt library to find a feasible value. (+)
			nlopt failure. Just use sampling for now. (+)
		Implement your own random number generator (http://tinyurl.com/ney6h9j) to check C++ implementation against the Matlab one. (-)
		Use Levenberg-Marquardt implementation in gtsam to compute line and polynomial intersection. (-)
			Decided against this. Use the one-dimensional search described in Director's 77 paper. (-)
	Use the one-dimensional search described in Director's 77 paper in 2D Matlab implementation. (-)
	Prove to yourself that the distance constraints are locally convex. (+)
	Cut all checks from matlab implementation.

Finish the paper. (-)
	Prove that the distance constraints are locally convex. (-)
	Analyze the complexity of the simplicial approximation with the additional nonlinear checks. (-)
		Put the analysis in terms of number of variables and the degree of the polynomials.
