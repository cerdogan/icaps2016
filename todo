Write a c++ program that generates a convex hull inside a feasible region in any dimension and for any number of constraints. (-)
	Write a matlab program that generates a convex hull inside a feasible region for 2 dimensions. (-)
		Clean up previous simplicial matlab code. (-)
			In the computation of the initial hull, make sure the simplex lives in d-space (e.g. in 2D, all the vertices are not colinear). (+)
				Make use of condition numbers (although not always perfect results). (+)
			Print the random number generator in the start of program to debug random phenomena. (+)
	It takes 3.5 seconds to just compute the initial hull in Matlab for 2 dimensions. Write the code in C++ and compare. (-)
Finish the paper. (-)
